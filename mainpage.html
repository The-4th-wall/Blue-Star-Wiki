        <u> 
            <h1> Appearance</h1>
        </u>
            <p> 
                Myrios is dark-skinned with golden-yellow eyes. They have dark blue hair that is chopped, and the right side of their hair is longer than the left side. The left side of their hair has a small braid similar to how in the past they wore their hair in a long braid. They were black turtlenecks that covered the scar of their beheading with a cropped yellow jacket and white puffer sleeves with yellow stripes on them. They have a yellow earring and black earpiece to hear any communication with the others. They wear a black and yellow belt to hold their microphone that sits on their waist and white cargo pants with white sneakers. 
                </p>
                <p> In the past, their hair is worn in a long braid. They wore a black crop top with a yellow strip in the middle and a yellow necklace with an M on it. Their sleeves are black at the tops with a yellow long cuff on it and a black pattern in the yellow. Their top has yellow straps that hang on the side of the outfit. They also have a black belt with hanging suspender belt loops on their side. Also they wear black cargo pants with white sneakers. 
                </p>
        <u>
            <h1>Personality</h1> 
        </u>
            <p>Myrios is an overachieving idiot who constantly assures people they have everything under control when they have no idea what they are even doing. They fully believe that everything will fall into place if they think it will leading them to rely mostly on themself. They are fairly quick-witted and great at developing plans and adapting to new situations. Although most of their plans don’t go according to plan and they tend to get caught up in their lies or forget they were even lying in the first place. Once they decide they are going to do something they choose to go 100% into that mission and reluctantly call upon help from others because they don’t want to put others in danger. Myrios puts on a friendly and welcoming persona to others but hates dealing with rude people (despite the fact their brother is an A-tier hater) and they lose their cool when everything is falling out of control way too fast for them to catch up. 
            </p>
        <u> 
            <h1>Abilities</h1>
        </u>
            <p>Myrios' abilities are music hypnosis and divinity. Music Hypnosis is the ability to hypnotize people with the power of music. Any type of music can be used as a buff. Divinity is a blessing from the gods that allows users to harness their god's abilities. </p>
        <u> 
            <h1>Trivia</h1>
        </u>
            <p>Their nickname is Songbird. They have 2 older siblings and a niece and two grandnephews. Myrios is also a famous popstar.</p>
