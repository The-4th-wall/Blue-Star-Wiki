    <h2>Childhood</h2>
</u>
<p>In Antraxia, Myrios started their idol career from a young age training since they were ten years old and eventually debuting at 16. Their parents were highly supportive of both being involved in the music industry but that all came crumbling down when Nexus decided to destroy Antraxia. Luckily Myrios had been kidnapped saved by the original Blue Star and brought into Devos. From there the four of them would travel to various places experiencing life with one another. 
</p>
<u>
    <h2>Devos</h2> 
</u>
    <p>Myrios met Urith and Vendetta and became their sworn sibling. The three of them consider them true family and although Myrios is not a God like the twins, they still treat each other with respect. About their family, Myrios is the evening and when Myrios takes breaks from their idol career they go spend their days with their siblings. Unaware of the crimes that their friends have committed which was the murder of North Wind to weaken the tyrant of Devos. 
    </p>
    <p>Myrios picked up their idol career in Devos once more quickly becoming a universal sensation striking numerous brand deals but that fame drew the ire of Nexus, who put together that Myrios knew something about the disappearance of North Wind. Upon deciding the four of them were guilty of a crime, Myrios had no clue about. The four of them were publicly executed (Myrios was beheaded). Myrios was later resurrected by Nexus to find the pieces of North Wind believing that Myrios does know where the man can be found (Myrios was kept in teh dark about this all) and Myrios obliged to let their friends come to rest and not become puppets of Nexus or be more power to feed this power hungry monster. 
    </p>
<u> 
    <h2>Blue Star</h2>
</u>
    <p>
        Myrios started up Blue Star and recruited the various memebers. The 8 of them traveling from world to world to help people.
